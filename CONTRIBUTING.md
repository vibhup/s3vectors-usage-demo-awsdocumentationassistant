## 📋 Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- **Python**: Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- **JavaScript**: Use ES6+ features, consistent formatting
- **Comments**: Write clear, concise comments for complex logic

### Testing
- Test all AWS integrations with appropriate mocks
- Verify UI components work across different browsers
- Include performance tests for RAG pipeline

### Documentation
- Update README.md for significant changes
- Add inline code documentation
- Update architecture diagrams if needed

### Low Priority
- **Integrations**: Connect with other AWS services
- **Customization**: Make system more configurable
- **Examples**: Add more use case examples

## 🔧 Technical Considerations

### AWS Services
- **S3 Vectors**: Vector database for semantic search
- **Amazon Bedrock**: AI models (Claude, Titan)
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute
- **API Gateway**: REST API management
- **CloudFront**: Global content delivery

### Performance
- Keep Lambda cold starts under 2 seconds
- Optimize vector search queries
- Minimize Bedrock token usage
- Implement effective caching strategies

### Security
- Follow AWS security best practices
- Use least privilege IAM policies
- Implement proper input validation
- Secure API endpoints appropriately

## 🚀 Release Process
