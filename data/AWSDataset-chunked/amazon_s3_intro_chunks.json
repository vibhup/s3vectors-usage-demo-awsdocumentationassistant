For\nexample, you can store mission-critical production data in S3 Standard or S3 Express One Zone for frequent\naccess, save costs by storing infrequently accessed data in S3 Standard-IA or\nS3 One Zone-IA, and archive data at the lowest costs in S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval,\nS3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep Archive.\n\nAmazon S3 Express One Zone is a high-performance, single-zone Amazon S3 storage class that is purpose-built\nto deliver consistent, single-digit millisecond data access for your most\nlatency-sensitive applications. S3 Express One Zone is the lowest latency cloud object\nstorage class available today, with data access\nspeeds\nup to 10x faster and with request costs\n50\npercent lower than S3 Standard. S3 Express One Zone is the first S3 storage class where you can select a single Availability Zone with\nthe option to co-locate your object storage with your compute resources, which provides the highest possible access speed.\nAdditionally, to further increase access speed and support hundreds of thousands of\nrequests per second, data is stored in a new bucket type: an\nAmazon S3 directory bucket.\n\nYou can store data with changing or unknown access patterns in\nS3 Intelligent-Tiering, which optimizes storage costs by automatically moving your\ndata between four access tiers when your access patterns change. These four access\ntiers include two low-latency access tiers optimized for frequent and infrequent\naccess, and two opt-in archive access tiers designed for asynchronous access for\nrarely accessed data.",

We recommend that you keep all Block Public Access\n  settings enabled unless you know that you need to turn off one or more of\n  them for your specific use case.\n* **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** – IAM is a web service that helps\n  you securely control access to AWS resources, including your Amazon S3\n  resources.

As a general rule, we\n  recommend using S3 resource-based policies (bucket policies and access point\n  policies) or IAM user policies for access control instead of ACLs.\n  Policies are a simplified and more flexible access control option.\n* **S3 Object Ownership** – Take ownership of every object\n  in your bucket, simplifying access management for data stored in Amazon S3.\n  S3 Object Ownership is an Amazon S3 bucket-level setting that you can use to\n  disable or enable ACLs.

By default, you can create up to 100 directory buckets in your\nAWS account, with no limit on the number of objects that you can store in a directory bucket. Directory buckets organize objects into hierarchical directories (prefixes) instead of the flat storage structure\nof general purpose buckets.\n\n* For low-latency use cases, you can create a directory bucket in a single AWS Availability Zone to store data.
