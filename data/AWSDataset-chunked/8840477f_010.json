  "content": "### Resource-based policies\n\nResource-based policies are JSON policy documents that you attach to a resource such as\nan Amazon S3 bucket. These policies grant the specified principal permission to perform specific\nactions on that resource and defines under what conditions this applies. Resource-based\npolicies are inline policies. There are no managed resource-based policies.\n\nTo enable cross-account access, you can specify an entire account or IAM entities in\nanother account as the principal in a resource-based policy. Adding a cross-account\nprincipal to a resource-based policy is only half of establishing the trust relationship.\nWhen the principal and the resource are in separate AWS accounts, you must also use an\nidentity-based policy to grant the principal access to the resource. However, if a\nresource-based policy grants access to a principal in the same account, no additional\nidentity-based policy is required.\n\nThe IAM service supports only one type of resource-based policy called a role\n*trust policy*, which is attached to an IAM role. An\nIAM role is both an identity and a resource that supports resource-based policies. For\nthat reason, you must attach both a trust policy and an identity-based policy to an IAM\nrole. Trust policies define which principal entities (accounts, users, roles, and federated\nusers) can assume the role.",
