Amazon RDS supports the following database engines:\n\n* **IBM Db2** - Enterprise-grade database for mission-critical applications\n* **MariaDB** - Open-source relational database, MySQL-compatible\n* **Microsoft SQL Server** - Microsoft's relational database management system\n* **MySQL** - Popular open-source relational database\n* **Oracle Database** - Enterprise database with advanced features\n* **PostgreSQL** - Advanced open-source object-relational database\n\nEach DB engine has its own supported features, and each version of a DB engine can include\nspecific features. Support for Amazon RDS features varies across AWS Regions and specific\nversions of each DB engine.\n\nAdditionally, each DB engine has a set of parameters in a DB parameter group that control the behavior of the\ndatabases that it manages.",
