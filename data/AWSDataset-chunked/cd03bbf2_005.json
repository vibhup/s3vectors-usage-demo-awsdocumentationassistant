  "content": "### Message lifecycle\n\nThe following scenario describes the lifecycle of an Amazon SQS message in a queue, from\ncreation to deletion.\n\n1. A producer (Component 1) sends message A to a queue, and the\nmessage is distributed across the Amazon SQS servers redundantly.\n\n2. When a consumer (Component 2) is ready to process messages, it\nconsumes messages from the queue, and message A is returned. While message A is being\nprocessed, it remains in the queue and isn't returned to subsequent receive requests for\nthe duration of the visibility\ntimeout.\n\n3. The consumer (Component 2) deletes message A from the queue to\nprevent the message from being received and processed again when the visibility timeout\nexpires.\n\n**Note**\n\nAmazon SQS automatically deletes messages that have been in a queue for more than the\nmaximum message retention period. The default message retention period is 4 days.\nHowever, you can set the message retention period to a value from 60 seconds to\n1,209,600 seconds (14 days) using the `SetQueueAttributes` action.",
