API developers can create APIs that\naccess AWS or other web services, as well as data stored in the AWS Cloud. As an API Gateway\nAPI developer, you can create APIs for use in your own client applications. Or you can make\nyour APIs available to third-party app developers.\n\nAPI Gateway creates RESTful APIs that:\n\n* Are HTTP-based.\n* Enable stateless client-server communication.\n* Implement standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.\n\nAPI Gateway creates WebSocket APIs that:\n\n* Adhere to the WebSocket\n  protocol, which enables stateful, full-duplex communication between client and\n  server.\n* Route incoming messages based on message content.",

API Gateway handles all the tasks involved in accepting and\nprocessing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls. These tasks include\ntraffic management, authorization and access control, monitoring, and API version\nmanagement.\n\nAPI Gateway acts as a \"front door\" for applications to access data, business logic, or\nfunctionality from your backend services, such as workloads running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud\n(Amazon EC2), code running on AWS Lambda, any web application, or real-time communication\napplications.",

SDKs simplify authentication, integrate easily with your development\n  environment, and provide access to API Gateway commands.\n* **API Gateway V1 and V2 APIs** – If you're using\n  a programming language that an SDK isn't available for, see the Amazon API Gateway Version 1 API Reference\n  and Amazon API Gateway Version 2 API Reference.\n* **AWS Command Line Interface** – For more information, see\n  Getting Set Up with the AWS Command Line Interface in the\n  *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide*.\n* **AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell** – For more information, see\n  Setting Up the AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell in the\n  *AWS Tools for PowerShell User Guide*.",
