  "content": "### Design Principles\n\n**Automatically recover from failure**\nBy monitoring a workload for key performance indicators (KPIs), you can trigger automation when a threshold is breached.\n\n**Test recovery procedures**\nIn an on-premises environment, testing is often conducted to prove that the workload works in a particular scenario. Testing is not typically used to validate recovery strategies.\n\n**Scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability**\nReplace one large resource with multiple small resources to reduce the impact of a single failure on the overall workload.\n\n**Stop guessing capacity**\nA common cause of failure in on-premises workloads is resource saturation, when the demands placed on a workload exceed the capacity of that workload.\n\n**Manage change in automation**\nChanges to your infrastructure should be made using automation. The changes that need to be managed include changes to the automation, which then can be tracked and reviewed.",
