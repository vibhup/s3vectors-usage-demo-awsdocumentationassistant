  "content": "## Identities\n\nWhen you create an AWS account, you begin with one sign-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services\nand resources in the account. This identity is called the AWS account *root user* and is accessed by\nsigning in with the email address and password that you used to create the account. We\nstrongly recommend that you don't use the root user for your everyday tasks. Safeguard your root user credentials and use them to\nperform the tasks that only the root user can perform.\n\nUse IAM to set up other identities in addition to your\nroot user, such as administrators, analysts, and developers, and grant them access to the resources\nthey need to succeed in their tasks.",
