  "content": "### Design Principles\n\n**Implement cloud financial management**\nTo achieve financial success and accelerate business value realization in the cloud, invest in Cloud Financial Management and Cost Optimization.\n\n**Adopt a consumption model**\nPay only for the computing resources you consume, and increase or decrease usage depending on business requirements.\n\n**Measure overall efficiency**\nMeasure the business output of the workload and the costs associated with delivery. Use this data to make informed decisions about future resource investments.\n\n**Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting**\nAWS does the heavy lifting of data center operations like racking, stacking, and powering servers. It also removes the operational burden of managing operating systems and applications with managed services.\n\n**Analyze and attribute expenditure**\nThe cloud makes it easier to accurately identify the cost and usage of workloads, which then allows transparent attribution of IT costs to revenue streams and individual workload owners.",
