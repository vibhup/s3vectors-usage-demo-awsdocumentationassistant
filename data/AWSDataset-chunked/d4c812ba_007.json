This centralized approach enables you to create cross-account dashboards,\nset up alarms that watch metrics from multiple accounts, and perform root-cause analysis across account\nboundaries. With CloudWatch cross-account observability, you can link source accounts either individually or\nlink them automatically through AWS Organizations.",
