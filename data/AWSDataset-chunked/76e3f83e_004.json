To support a wide variety of use cases, DynamoDB supports both key-value and\ndocument data models.\n\nUnlike relational databases, DynamoDB doesn't support a JOIN operator. We recommend\nthat you denormalize your data model to reduce database round trips and processing\npower needed to answer queries. As a NoSQL database, DynamoDB provides strong read consistency and ACID\ntransactions to build enterprise-grade applications.",
