Identity-based policies can be further categorized:\n\n* **Managed policies** – Standalone identity-based policies that you can attach to\n  multiple users, groups, and roles in your AWS account. There are two types of managed\n  policies:\n\n  + **AWS managed policies** – Managed\n    policies that are created and managed by AWS.\n  + **Customer managed policies** – Managed\n    policies that you create and manage in your AWS account. Customer managed policies\n    provide more precise control over your policies than AWS managed policies.\n* **Inline policies** – Policies that you add directly to a single user, group,\n  or role. Inline policies maintain a strict one-to-one relationship between a policy and\n  an identity. They are deleted when you delete the identity.",
