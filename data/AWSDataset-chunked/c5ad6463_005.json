  "content": "### Application integration\n\nThe *Fanout* scenario is when a message published\nto an SNS topic is replicated and pushed to multiple endpoints, such as Firehose\ndelivery streams, Amazon SQS queues, HTTP(S) endpoints, and Lambda functions. This allows\nfor parallel asynchronous processing.\n\nFor example, you can develop an application that publishes a message to an SNS\ntopic whenever an order is placed for a product. Then, SQS queues that are\nsubscribed to the SNS topic receive identical notifications for the new order. An\nAmazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) server instance attached to one of the SQS queues can handle the\nprocessing or fulfillment of the order. And you can attach another Amazon EC2 server\ninstance to a data warehouse for analysis of all orders received.\n\nYou can also use fanout to replicate data sent to your production environment with\nyour test environment. Expanding upon the previous example, you can subscribe\nanother SQS queue to the same SNS topic for new incoming orders. Then, by attaching\nthis new SQS queue to your test environment, you can continue to improve and test\nyour application using data received from your production environment.\n\n**Important**\n\nMake sure that you consider data privacy and security before you send any\nproduction data to your test environment.",
