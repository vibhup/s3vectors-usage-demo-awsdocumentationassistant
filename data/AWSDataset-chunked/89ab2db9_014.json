  "content": "### Design Principles\n\n**Democratize advanced technologies**\nMake advanced technology implementation easier for your team by delegating complex tasks to your cloud vendor.\n\n**Go global in minutes**\nDeploying your workload in multiple AWS Regions around the world allows you to provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost.\n\n**Use serverless architectures**\nServerless architectures remove the need for you to run and maintain physical servers for traditional compute activities.\n\n**Experiment more often**\nWith virtual and automatable resources, you can quickly carry out comparative testing using different types of instances, storage, or configurations.\n\n**Consider mechanical sympathy**\nUnderstand how cloud services are consumed and always use the technology approach that aligns best with your workload goals.",
