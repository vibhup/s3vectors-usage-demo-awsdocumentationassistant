  "content": "## Terminology and components\n\nThere are three layers in Amazon ECS:\n\n* **Capacity** - The infrastructure where your containers run\n* **Controller** - Deploy and manage your applications that run on the\n  containers\n* **Provisioning** - The tools that you can use to interface with the scheduler to\n  deploy and manage your applications and containers\n\nThe capacity is the infrastructure where your containers run. The following is an\noverview of the capacity options:\n\n* **Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS cloud**\n\n  You choose the instance type, the number of instances, and manage the\n  capacity.\n* **Serverless (AWS Fargate) in the AWS cloud**\n\n  Fargate is a serverless, pay-as-you-go compute engine. With Fargate you\n  don't need to manage servers, handle capacity planning, or isolate container\n  workloads for security.\n* **On-premises virtual machines (VM) or servers**\n\n  Amazon ECS Anywhere provides support for registering an external instance such as\n  an on-premises server or virtual machine (VM), to your Amazon ECS cluster.\n\nThe Amazon ECS scheduler is the software that manages your applications.",
