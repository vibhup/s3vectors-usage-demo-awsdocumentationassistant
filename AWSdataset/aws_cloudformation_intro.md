# What is AWS CloudFormation?

AWS CloudFormation is a service that helps you model and set up your AWS resources so that you can
spend less time managing those resources and more time focusing on your applications that
run in AWS. You create a template that describes all the AWS resources that you want
(like Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon RDS DB instances), and CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and
configuring those resources for you. You don't need to individually create and configure
AWS resources and figure out what's dependent on what; CloudFormation handles that. The
following scenarios demonstrate how CloudFormation can help.

## Simplify infrastructure management

For a scalable web application that also includes a backend database, you might use an
Auto Scaling group, an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer, and an Amazon Relational Database Service database instance. You might use
each individual service to provision these resources and after you create the resources,
you would have to configure them to work together. All these tasks can add complexity
and time before you even get your application up and running.

Instead, you can create a CloudFormation template or modify an existing one. A
*template* describes all your resources and their properties.
When you use that template to create a CloudFormation stack, CloudFormation provisions the Auto Scaling
group, load balancer, and database for you. After the stack has been successfully
created, your AWS resources are up and running. You can delete the stack just as
easily, which deletes all the resources in the stack. By using CloudFormation, you easily
manage a collection of resources as a single unit.

## Quickly replicate your infrastructure

If your application requires additional availability, you might replicate it in
multiple regions so that if one region becomes unavailable, your users can still use
your application in other regions. The challenge in replicating your application is that
it also requires you to replicate your resources. Not only do you need to record all the
resources that your application requires, but you must also provision and configure
those resources in each region.

Reuse your CloudFormation template to create your resources in a consistent and repeatable
manner. To reuse your template, describe your resources once and then provision the same
resources over and over in multiple regions.

## Easily control and track changes to your infrastructure

In some cases, you might have underlying resources that you want to upgrade
incrementally. For example, you might change to a higher performing instance type in
your Auto Scaling launch configuration so that you can reduce the maximum number of instances in
your Auto Scaling group. If problems occur after you complete the update, you might need to roll
back your infrastructure to the original settings. To do this manually, you not only
have to remember which resources were changed, you also have to know what the original
settings were.

When you provision your infrastructure with CloudFormation, the CloudFormation template
describes exactly what resources are provisioned and their settings. Because these
templates are text files, you simply track differences in your templates to track
changes to your infrastructure, similar to the way developers control revisions to
source code. For example, you can use a version control system with your templates so
that you know exactly what changes were made, who made them, and when. If at any point
you need to reverse changes to your infrastructure, you can use a previous version of
your template.

## Getting started with CloudFormation

CloudFormation is available through the CloudFormation console, API,
AWS CLI, AWS SDKs, and through several integrations.

## Key Benefits of AWS CloudFormation

### Infrastructure as Code
CloudFormation allows you to treat your infrastructure as code. You can version control your templates, review changes before deployment, and maintain consistency across environments.

### Declarative Templates
You describe what you want your infrastructure to look like, and CloudFormation figures out how to create it. Templates can be written in JSON or YAML format.

### Dependency Management
CloudFormation automatically handles resource dependencies. If Resource A depends on Resource B, CloudFormation will create Resource B first.

### Stack Management
Resources are organized into stacks, which are collections of AWS resources that you can manage as a single unit. You can create, update, or delete entire stacks.

### Change Sets
Before making changes to a stack, you can create a change set to preview how your changes will affect running resources.

### Rollback Capabilities
If stack creation or update fails, CloudFormation can automatically roll back to the previous working state.

### Cross-Region and Cross-Account Deployment
You can deploy the same template across multiple AWS regions and accounts for consistent infrastructure.

## Common Use Cases

### Multi-Tier Applications
Deploy complete application stacks including web servers, application servers, databases, and networking components.

### Development and Testing Environments
Quickly spin up identical environments for development, testing, and staging.

### Disaster Recovery
Replicate your production infrastructure in different regions for disaster recovery purposes.

### Compliance and Governance
Ensure consistent security configurations and compliance across all deployments.

### Cost Management
Easily tear down entire environments when not needed to save costs.

## Template Structure

CloudFormation templates consist of several sections:

- **AWSTemplateFormatVersion**: Template format version
- **Description**: Template description
- **Parameters**: Input values for the template
- **Mappings**: Static lookup tables
- **Conditions**: Control resource creation based on conditions
- **Resources**: AWS resources to create (required)
- **Outputs**: Values to return after stack creation

## Integration with Other AWS Services

CloudFormation integrates with many AWS services including:

- **AWS Config**: Track configuration changes
- **AWS CloudTrail**: Log API calls
- **Amazon SNS**: Send notifications about stack events
- **AWS IAM**: Control access to CloudFormation operations
- **AWS Systems Manager**: Store parameters and secrets
