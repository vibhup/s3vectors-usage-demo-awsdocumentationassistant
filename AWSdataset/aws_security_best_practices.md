# AWS Security Best Practices Guide

Security is a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer. AWS is responsible for securing the underlying infrastructure that supports the cloud, and customers are responsible for securing their workloads and data in the cloud. This comprehensive guide covers security best practices across all aspects of AWS.

## Shared Responsibility Model

### AWS Responsibilities (Security OF the Cloud)
- Physical security of data centers
- Hardware and software infrastructure
- Network infrastructure
- Virtualization infrastructure
- Managed services security

### Customer Responsibilities (Security IN the Cloud)
- Operating system updates and security patches
- Network and firewall configuration
- Application-level security
- Identity and access management
- Data encryption
- Network traffic protection

## Identity and Access Management (IAM) Best Practices

### Principle of Least Privilege
Grant users and services only the minimum permissions necessary to perform their tasks.

**Implementation:**
- Start with no permissions and add only what's needed
- Use IAM policies to define granular permissions
- Regularly review and audit permissions
- Use IAM Access Analyzer to identify unused permissions

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Enable MFA for all users, especially those with administrative privileges.

**MFA Options:**
- Virtual MFA devices (Google Authenticator, Authy)
- Hardware MFA devices (YubiKey, RSA tokens)
- SMS text messages (less secure, not recommended for sensitive accounts)

### Root Account Security
The root account has complete access to all AWS services and resources.

**Best Practices:**
- Don't use root account for everyday tasks
- Enable MFA on root account
- Use strong, unique password
- Regularly rotate access keys (if any exist)
- Monitor root account usage with CloudTrail

### IAM Users and Groups
Organize users into groups based on job functions and assign permissions to groups.

**Best Practices:**
- Create individual IAM users for each person
- Use groups to assign permissions
- Avoid sharing user accounts
- Implement strong password policies
- Rotate access keys regularly

### IAM Roles
Use IAM roles for applications and services that need to access AWS resources.

**Benefits:**
- Temporary security credentials
- No need to embed long-term credentials
- Automatic credential rotation
- Cross-account access capabilities

**Common Use Cases:**
- EC2 instances accessing other AWS services
- Lambda functions requiring AWS service access
- Cross-account resource access
- Federated user access

### Service Control Policies (SCPs)
Use SCPs with AWS Organizations to set permission guardrails.

**Key Features:**
- Preventive controls that set maximum permissions
- Apply to organizational units or individual accounts
- Don't grant permissions, only restrict them
- Help maintain compliance across multiple accounts

## Data Protection

### Encryption at Rest
Encrypt sensitive data stored in AWS services.

**AWS Services with Encryption:**
- **S3**: Server-side encryption with S3-managed keys (SSE-S3), KMS keys (SSE-KMS), or customer-provided keys (SSE-C)
- **EBS**: Encryption using AWS KMS keys
- **RDS**: Transparent data encryption for database instances
- **DynamoDB**: Encryption at rest using AWS managed or customer managed KMS keys
- **Redshift**: Cluster encryption using AWS KMS or HSM

**Best Practices:**
- Enable encryption by default where possible
- Use AWS KMS for key management
- Implement key rotation policies
- Monitor key usage with CloudTrail

### Encryption in Transit
Protect data as it moves between services and clients.

**Implementation Methods:**
- Use HTTPS/TLS for web traffic
- Use SSL/TLS for database connections
- Enable VPC endpoints for private connectivity
- Use AWS Certificate Manager for SSL/TLS certificates

**AWS Services Supporting Encryption in Transit:**
- CloudFront with HTTPS
- Application Load Balancer with SSL termination
- API Gateway with TLS
- RDS with SSL connections
- ElastiCache with encryption in transit

### Key Management with AWS KMS
AWS Key Management Service (KMS) provides centralized key management.

**Key Types:**
- **AWS Managed Keys**: Created and managed by AWS services
- **Customer Managed Keys**: Created and managed by customers
- **AWS Owned Keys**: Used by AWS services, not visible to customers

**Best Practices:**
- Use customer managed keys for sensitive data
- Implement key rotation policies
- Use key policies and IAM policies together
- Monitor key usage with CloudTrail
- Use grants for temporary access

### Data Classification
Classify data based on sensitivity and apply appropriate protection measures.

**Classification Levels:**
- **Public**: No harm if disclosed
- **Internal**: Limited harm if disclosed
- **Confidential**: Significant harm if disclosed
- **Restricted**: Severe harm if disclosed

**Protection Measures by Classification:**
- Public: Basic access controls
- Internal: Encryption in transit, access logging
- Confidential: Encryption at rest and in transit, strict access controls
- Restricted: Strong encryption, multi-factor authentication, audit logging

## Network Security

- Regularly review and clean up unused rules
- Document the purpose of each rule

### Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)
Implement subnet-level network filtering with NACLs.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Stateless (must configure both inbound and outbound rules)

- Support both allow and deny rules
- Apply to all instances in associated subnets

**Best Practices:**
- Use NACLs as an additional layer of security
- Keep rules simple and well-documented
