This enables resolution of DNS queries between\n    the Outposts racks and your other on-premises resources.\n\n**Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall**\n:   Protect your recursive DNS queries within the Route 53 Resolver. Create domain lists and build firewall rules that filter outbound DNS traffic against these rules.\n\n**Traffic Flow**\n:   Easy-to-use and cost-effective global traffic management: route end users to the best endpoint for your application based on geoproximity, latency, health, and other considerations.\n\n**Amazon Route 53 Profiles**\n:   With Route 53 Profiles, you can apply and manage DNS-related Route 53 configurations across many VPCs and in different AWS account.",
