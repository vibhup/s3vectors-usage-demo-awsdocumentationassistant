  "content": "### Serverless\n\nWith DynamoDB, you don't need to provision any servers, or patch, manage, install,\nmaintain, or operate any software. DynamoDB provides zero downtime maintenance. It has\nno versions (major, minor, or patch), and there are no maintenance windows.\n\nDynamoDB's on-demand capacity mode\noffers pay-as-you-go pricing for read and write requests so you only pay for what\nyou use. With on-demand, DynamoDB instantly scales up or down your tables to adjust for\ncapacity and maintains performance with zero administration. It also scales down to\nzero so you don't pay for throughput when your table doesn't have traffic and there\nare no cold starts.",
