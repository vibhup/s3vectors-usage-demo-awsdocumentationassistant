SCPs are JSON policies that specify the\nmaximum permissions for IAM users and IAM roles within accounts of an organization or\norganizational unit (OU). The SCP limits permissions for principals in member accounts,\nincluding each AWS account root user. An explicit deny in any of these policies overrides an allow in\nother policies.",
