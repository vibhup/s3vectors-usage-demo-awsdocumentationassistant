  "content": "# What is Amazon EC2?\n\nAmazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides on-demand, scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web\nServices (AWS) Cloud. Using Amazon EC2 reduces hardware costs so you can develop and deploy\napplications faster. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you\nneed, configure security and networking, and manage storage. You can add capacity (scale up)\nto handle compute-heavy tasks, such as monthly or yearly processes, or spikes in website\ntraffic. When usage decreases, you can reduce capacity (scale down) again.\n\nAn EC2 instance is a virtual server in the AWS Cloud. When you launch an EC2 instance,\nthe instance type that you specify determines the hardware available to your instance.\nEach instance type offers a different balance of compute, memory, network, and storage\nresources.",
