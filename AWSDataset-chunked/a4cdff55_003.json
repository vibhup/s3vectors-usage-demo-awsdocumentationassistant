The challenge in replicating your application is that\nit also requires you to replicate your resources. Not only do you need to record all the\nresources that your application requires, but you must also provision and configure\nthose resources in each region.\n\nReuse your CloudFormation template to create your resources in a consistent and repeatable\nmanner. To reuse your template, describe your resources once and then provision the same\nresources over and over in multiple regions.",
