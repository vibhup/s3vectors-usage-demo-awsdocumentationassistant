  "content": "## Pricing for Amazon VPC\n\nThere's no additional charge for using a VPC. There are, however, charges for some VPC\ncomponents, such as NAT gateways, IP Address Manager, traffic mirroring, Reachability Analyzer, and\nNetwork Access Analyzer.\n\nNearly all resources that you launch in your virtual private cloud (VPC) provide you\nwith an IP address for connectivity. The vast majority of resources in your VPC use\nprivate IPv4 addresses. Resources that require direct access to the internet over IPv4,\nhowever, use public IPv4 addresses.\n\nAmazon VPC enables you to launch managed services, such as Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon RDS, and Amazon EMR, without having a VPC set up beforehand. It does this by using the default\nVPC in your account if you have\none. Any public IPv4 addresses provisioned to your account by the managed\nservice will be charged. These charges will be associated with Amazon VPC service in\nyour AWS Cost and Usage Report.\n\n**Pricing for public IPv4 addresses**\n\nA *public IPv4 address* is an IPv4 address that is\nroutable from the internet. A public IPv4 address is necessary for a resource to be\ndirectly reachable from the internet over IPv4.\n\nIf you are an existing or new AWS Free Tier\ncustomer, you get 750 hours of public IPv4 address usage with the EC2 service at no\ncharge. If you are not using the EC2 service in the AWS Free Tier, Public IPv4\naddresses are charged.\n\nPrivate IPv4 addresses (RFC\n1918) are not charged.\n\nPublic IPv4 addresses have the following types:\n\n* **Elastic IP addresses (EIPs)**: Static, public IPv4 addresses\n  provided by Amazon that you can associate with an EC2 instance, elastic network\n  interface, or AWS resource.\n* **EC2 public IPv4 addresses**: Public IPv4 addresses assigned to\n  an EC2 instance by Amazon (if the EC2 instance is launched into a default subnet or\n  if the instance is launched into a subnet that's been configured to automatically\n  assign a public IPv4 address).\n* **BYOIPv4 addresses**: Public IPv4 addresses in the IPv4 address\n  range that you've brought to AWS using Bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP).\n* **Service-managed IPv4 addresses**: Public IPv4 addresses\n  automatically provisioned on AWS resources and managed by an AWS service. For\n  example, public IPv4 addresses on Amazon ECS, Amazon RDS, or Amazon WorkSpaces.\n\nThe following list shows the most common AWS services that can use public IPv4\naddresses:\n\n* Amazon AppStream 2.0\n* AWS Client VPN\n* AWS Database Migration Service\n* Amazon EC2\n* Amazon Elastic Container Service\n* Amazon EKS\n* Amazon EMR\n* Amazon GameLift Servers\n* AWS Global Accelerator\n* AWS Mainframe Modernization\n* Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka\n* Amazon MQ\n* Amazon RDS\n* Amazon Redshift\n* AWS Site-to-Site VPN\n* Amazon VPC NAT gateway\n* Amazon WorkSpaces\n* Elastic Load Balancing",
