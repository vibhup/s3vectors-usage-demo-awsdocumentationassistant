  "content": "## Operational visibility with metrics, alarms, and dashboards\n\nMetrics collect and track key performance data at user-defined intervals. Many AWS services automatically report metrics into CloudWatch, and you can also publish\ncustom metrics in CloudWatch from your applications.\n\nDashboards offer a unified view of your resources and applications with visualizations of your metrics and logs in a single location. You can also\nshare dashboards across accounts and Regions for enhanced operational awareness. CloudWatch provides curated automatic dashboards for many AWS services,\nso that you don't have to build them yourself.\n\nYou can set up alarms that continuously monitor CloudWatch metrics against user-defined thresholds. They can automatically alert you to breaches of the thresholds, and\ncan also automatically respond to changes in your resources' behavior by triggering automated actions.",
