Logs ingested from AWS services and custom applications are stored in\nlog groups and streams for easy organization.\nUse CloudWatch Logs Insights to perform interactive, fast queries on your log data, with a choice of three query languages including SQL and PPL.\nUse log anomaly detection to find unusual patterns in log events in a log group, which can indicate issues.\nCreate metric filters to extract numerical values from logs and generate CloudWatch metrics, which you can use for alerting and dashboards.\nSet up subscription filters to process and analyze logs in real-time or route them to other services like Amazon S3 or Firehose.",
