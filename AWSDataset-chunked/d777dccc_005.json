Lambda SnapStart can provide as low as sub-second startup performance, typically with no changes to your function code.\n* [Response streaming](./configuration-response-streaming.html \"./configuration-response-streaming.html\") optimize function performance by delivering large payloads incrementally for real-time processing.\n* [Container images](./images-create.html \"./images-create.html\") package functions with complex dependencies using container workflows.\n\n**Connect and integrate seamlessly:**\n\n* [VPC networks](./configuration-vpc.html \"./configuration-vpc.html\") secure sensitive resources and internal services.\n* [File system](./configuration-filesystem.html \"./configuration-filesystem.html\") integration that shares persistent data and manage stateful operations across function invocations.\n* [Function URLs](./urls-configuration.html \"./urls-configuration.html\") create public-facing APIs and endpoints without additional services.\n* [Lambda extensions](./lambda-extensions.html \"./lambda-extensions.html\") augment functions with monitoring, security, and operational tools.",
