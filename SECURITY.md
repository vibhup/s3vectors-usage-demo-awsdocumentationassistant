# Security Guidelines

## üîê Important Security Notice

This repository contains **template code and placeholder values** for educational purposes. Before deploying to production, please follow these security best practices:

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Never Commit Sensitive Information

**DO NOT commit the following to version control:**

- AWS Access Keys or Secret Keys
- AWS Session Tokens
- Account IDs
- Resource ARNs with real account numbers
- CloudFront Distribution IDs
- API Gateway IDs
- Certificate ARNs
- S3 Bucket names (if they contain sensitive data)
- Route 53 Hosted Zone IDs
- Any configuration files with real AWS resource identifiers

## üõ°Ô∏è Placeholder Values Used

This repository uses placeholder values that you must replace with your own:

| Placeholder | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| `YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID` | Your AWS Account ID | `123456789012` |
| `YOUR-CLOUDFRONT-DISTRIBUTION-ID` | CloudFront Distribution ID | `E1234567890ABC` |
| `YOUR-API-GATEWAY-ID` | API Gateway ID | `abcd123456` |
| `YOUR-CLOUDFRONT-OAI-ID` | CloudFront OAI ID | `E1234567890DEF` |
| `YOUR-CERTIFICATE-ID` | ACM Certificate ID | `12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012` |
| `YOUR-S3-UI-BUCKET` | S3 bucket for UI | `my-app-ui-bucket` |
| `YOUR-VECTOR-BUCKET` | S3 Vectors bucket | `my-vector-bucket` |
| `YOUR-HOSTED-ZONE-ID` | Route 53 Hosted Zone ID | `Z1234567890ABC` |
| `your-custom-domain.com` | Your custom domain | `myapp.example.com` |

## üîß Secure Deployment Practices

### 1. Environment Variables
Use environment variables for sensitive configuration:

```bash
export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID="123456789012"
export VECTOR_BUCKET_NAME="my-vector-bucket"
export API_GATEWAY_ID="abcd123456"
```

### 2. AWS IAM Best Practices
- Use least privilege access
- Create specific IAM roles for each service
- Regularly rotate access keys
- Enable MFA where possible

### 3. Resource Naming
- Use descriptive but non-sensitive names
- Avoid including account IDs or personal information in resource names
- Use consistent naming conventions

### 4. Configuration Management
- Store sensitive configuration in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store
- Use AWS Secrets Manager for credentials
- Never hardcode sensitive values in source code

## üö® If You Accidentally Commit Sensitive Data

If you accidentally commit sensitive information:

1. **Immediately rotate any exposed credentials**
2. **Remove the sensitive data from git history:**
   ```bash
   git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
   'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch SENSITIVE_FILE' \
   --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
   ```
3. **Force push to update remote repository**
4. **Review AWS CloudTrail logs for any suspicious activity**

## üìû Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project:

1. **Do NOT create a public GitHub issue**
2. **Contact the maintainers privately**
3. **Provide detailed information about the vulnerability**
4. **Allow time for the issue to be addressed before public disclosure**
